Custom software for a Maccro Keyboard with 12 buttons and 3 Knobs bought on Amazon.

Known bugs:
- Media "Mute", "Play/Pause" are not working. I need the original software to be able to compare the commands..

This is a first release, so there may be bugs that im not aware of. If you want to help, please submit a pull request.
